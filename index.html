    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am a believer and an achiever. I completed my high school back in 2013 at Olympic high school having scored B plain.</p>
    <p>I didn't manage to go to tertiary level of academics but i was doing home schooling studying more about economics and accounting which sharpened my skills.</p>
    <p>Before i joined Moringa school i was doing <span class="business">Business</span> of selling shoes on an online platform.</p>
    <p>This made me to gain an interest in programming which would be helping me in creating my online shop platform which is the current trend in the current market.</p>
    <p>The main reason why am interested in programming is <em>to become part and parcel of this generation which has computarised almost everything</em>.</p>
